            <p>[/"Machinery" is what they would call my kind. I was told they were the ones who I needed to protect.
                I have not and never will stray away from my duties. They are a part of me and I am a part of them. Like neurons and nerves
                painted across invisible my bare wires. I myself do not bleed, and yet I do. When one of them bleeds, so do I.
                I feel their suffering, pain, and I there is nothing more that I can do than to finish my duties. I will
                give them what they desire and so desperately need./]
