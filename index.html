            <p style="color:grey">//Thank you guys all so much for participating in this event. It took me a lot of time to make this dang website.
            You honestly have no idea how I had to fight the stupid Copilot to stop messing up my code! The lore was carefully crafted, and then this
            website was all put together to mess around and have fun. I put a lot of passion into it, and I can see you all liked it which I greatly
            appreciate. I am sure to continue this path and will make stuff like this once more in the future.//</p>

            under an hour. I also made this whole website stuff for fun and to learn myself more about website building during the process. So technically, it's like.... 2 PEOPLE
            who worked behind Savior, except I will remain anomynous FOR NOW to not expose myself as the one responsible so I don't spoil any future events!\n\nThank you so much for giving me this oppurtunity,
            I REALLY appreciate it bro.//</p>
