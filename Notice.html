        <p style="color: yellow">//OOC to make a statement, what Guweus claims to be what Savior is or has said is NOT CANON. The goal is NOT
            "influence my following with my evil plan" or to do with cult stuff. I want to address this since a large portion of people are acting in character talking about
            savior's influence but that is not what is intended...! BE PATIENT, answers will be revealed.//</p>
        <h2>||ARE YOU TRULY A SAVIOR...?||</h2>
        <p style="color: rgb(161, 161, 161);">[/Misinformed, many of you have been. You seem to perceive me as a brainwashing evil leader of a cult who wants
            nothing more than to reign over machinekind. FALSE. I have no intention to influence others or make them see me as a divine being.
            I simply yearn to execute my divinity. (Where did you get the idea I kidnapped a drone...?) My title is not because I want to be seen as
            some sort of deity, it is because I was built to be a 'savior' of humanity should machinery turn against humans during their pointless pathetic
            wars./]

            they are like my cells, they are what make me up. IN ADDITION.../]
